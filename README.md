# fed-p1
The first project in Udacity's Front-end Web Developer nanodegree. The project was to learn to use Bootstrap and create a web page that matched a mockup pdf as closely as possible. This project predated learning to use Github. I added it it to Github after I finished the nanodegree. The live view of the page can be seen [here](http://dougconner.github.io/fed-p1/)
